        How do you take screenshot ? How you automated taking screenshot in your current project ?
        -There is an interface called TakesScreenshot
         I use getScreenshotAs methods.
          I have a utilies package and reusable methods class and I have a takeScreenshot method. I use that method.
          When do you take screenshots ?
          If my test scenario fails . To open a bug ticket we need some proves.
          If you find the bug with automation then there should be a method to provide a proof.
